# CheckMate Design

CheckMate is a design project created during the Human-Computer Interaction course at the University of Helsinki. It addresses the problem of obsessive checking behaviors before leaving home by combining a smart home device (CheckPoint) and a mobile application (CheckMate) into a cohesive system.

## System Overview

### CheckPoint
CheckPoint is a smart home device placed between an electrical cord and a socket. Its main functionalities include:
- Monitoring electricity usage of connected devices.
- Cutting off or restoring power remotely via the CheckMate application.
- Displaying the device status through an indicator light:
  - **Green**: All devices are off.
  - **Yellow**: At least one device is on.
  - **Red**: At least one CheckPoint device is manually shut down.

### CheckMate
CheckMate is a mobile application that complements the CheckPoint device with the following features:
- **Checklist Management**: Create, edit, and use checklists.
- **Remote Device Control**: Monitor and manage CheckPoint devices.
- **Statistics**: View trends and insights into user behavior and device usage.
- **Settings**: Adjust application settings, account details, notifications, and CheckPoint diagnostics.

## Key Features

### Main Views
1. **Login**: Secure access to the application.
2. **Checklist Management**: Add, edit, and mark items on checklists.
3. **CheckPoint View**: Monitor and control CheckPoint devices, add new devices.
4. **Statistics**: Analyze behavior and device usage trends.
5. **Settings**: Configure general preferences, account details, notifications, and CheckPoint settings.

### Purpose
The CheckMate system aims to reduce stress associated with obsessive checking behaviors by providing reliable tools for monitoring and control, while also encouraging self-reflection through statistics and insights.
